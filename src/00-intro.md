## Intro

This document defines the guidelines used for the design and development
of any software or hardware piece, pertaining to H4U.

### Design Principals and Philosophy

Humans4U aspires to become a humane-centered technology solution provider, where
the products are developed with the idea to follow accessible and inclusive as
possible.

The principals behind H4U design fall under:

- **User comfort** - Making sure that the user feels in charge and understands the processes happening within the solution.
- **Humane** - Making sure that the user feels that is treated in the most humane way. Not a number or a client.
- **Striving for good solution** - A solution for the sake of solving a problem is not enough. A solution must be designed with a real problem in mind.
